The purpose of this project is to showcase the available native features for geoJSON files in GitHub.
Read the GitHub Help article entitled [Mapping geoJSON files on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) for full documentation. The dataset referenced can be found on [Smart Columbus OS](https://www.smartcolumbusos.com/data) or at its source; the City of Columbus GIS Open Data and Map Portal: [Police Crime Cameras](http://opendata.columbus.gov/datasets/66d7824d67f84de29e0c46ef8d88f1b7_2).

Data was downloaded into a spreadsheet. Used website [ConvertCSV](http://www.convertcsv.com/) to change to geoJSON file type. Then used website [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/) to format.
